    "In order to improve the model we will first apply the MLP method on the prepared data in order to set a new, possibly improved, baseline. After that we will apply the PCA technique in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data set and remove the possible redundancies. After that , wi will train the MLP model with the data obtained from the PCA to  improve MLP training speed and reduce overfitting.Finally we evaluate the test set with all the changes applied in order to verify their effects on the model.\n",

    "As seen by de results, the data preparation allowed for a more stable model across every fold, since the scores in the data preparation are very close to 1. This is further confirmed with the weighted F1 of the new baseline model, which is higher than the original one. When applying the PCA technique, we reduce the 13 original features to 10 main components, preserving the variance and obtaining a perfect confussion matrix, which is the definite proof that the improvements on the dataset and the model have worked, not by outreforming the cross validatio test but in the test performance.\n"

    "We selected the following hyperparameters for our grid search: \n",
    "- `hidden_layer_sizes` - The wine dataset is relatively small (178 samples) which makes model's capacity particularly important. A network with too few neurons may not be flexible enough to capture underlying patterns and can underfit, while a network with too many neurons may memorize the training data and overfit. For this reason, we included both one-layer and two-layer configurations, to find an appropriate balance between model complexity and generalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `activation` - The activation gives the neural network the ability to learn complex patterns, not just straight linear relationships. Therefore we have included two most commonly used activations in MLPs namely relu and tanh. Relu can help with sparse gradients, while tanh is smoother and can perform better when input features are scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `alpha` - This parameter determines how strongly the model tries to keep the weights small to prevent overfitting. Because our dataset is small, regularization is important to help the model generalize well. By testing several values  of `alpha`,  we can find an appropriate balance between fitting the data and avoid overfitting. The selected values cover a reasonable range of regularization strengths:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `learning_rate_init` - The learning rate influences how the model updates its weights and how quickly it converges during training (decides how fast and how smoothly the model learns). If the learning rate is too high, the model becomes unstable and can't settle on a good solution. However, if it is too slow, training becomes slow and the model may get stuck before finding the best result. We test two commonly used values (0.001 and 0.01) to identify the most stable and efficient learning rate for the wine dataset."
